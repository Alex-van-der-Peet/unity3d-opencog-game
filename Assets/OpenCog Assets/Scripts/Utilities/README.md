#OpenCog.Utilities

* Purpose: The Utilities Scripts folder holds scripts that may be used either at edit or play time, and which serve some sort of helper, storage, algebraic, or miscellaneous function. 

### What to Store
* Store small structures & types, enumerated types, helper functions, and generics. 
* Typically, do not store Monobehaviors or Scriptable Objects.
* The exception to the above statement is when creating generics and base classes, such as the Singleton pattern which can be used anywhere in almost any project.
* Utilities scripts should feel generic and modular, as if they could be used in almost any project or in any part of our project. Helper functions specific to characters or worlds should be stored with the classes they assist.
